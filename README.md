#The dataset that will be used for this analysis is the Video Game Sales 2016 dataset from Kaggle.com. 
#The purpose of this analysis is to explore and find and potential trends in the variables present in this dataset in order to gain business insight.
#Some questions that I will attempt to answer by using this dataset are:
# 1) Which publishers have published the most games as of the release of this dataset?
# 2) Who are the leading developers of games at the time of release of this dataset?
# 3) Look at the trend of global sales all-time and which year video game sales peaked
# 4) Which genre of game (Action, RPG, Sports, etc.) has sold the most globally?
# 5) Which platform has sold the most games of all-time?
# 6) Breaking down the percentage of total sales by region (North America, Japan, Europe, Other)
